# Sofora website: guide for agents

Read this first. It is kept current; `README.md` has the full human-facing detail. If you change how something works, update this file in the same change.

## What this is

- `apps/web` (`@sofora/web`, port 5173): public website for Sofora Cooperative Credit Union. A faithful copy of the old WordPress site at soforaccu.com (same menu, wording, photos, old URLs such as `/about-us/`), rebuilt in React. Services were reorganised into one `/services/` hub with a page per product (`/services/car-loan/`); `/loan-services/` and `/saving/` redirect into it.
- `apps/portal` (`@sofora/portal`, port 5174): staff portal. Edit website content (save = live, no drafts), work membership/loan applications, manage staff.
- `convex/`: one Convex backend for both apps. Dev deployment `jovial-ptarmigan-163` (see root `.env.local`). See `convex/README.md` for the backend map.

## Run and check

- `npm start` / `npm stop`: Convex + both apps in the background; logs in `.dev/logs/`. Opens the browser.
- Portal login (dev only): `admin` / `admin` (also on the Vercel test portal while it uses the dev backend; the field accepts usernames whenever `devLogins:enabled` is true). Created by `convex/devLogins.ts`, only where the Convex env var `DEV_LOGINS=true` (set on the dev deployment, never production).
- `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`: both must pass. There are no automated tests. `pnpm typecheck` stops at the first failing app; `pnpm exec turbo run typecheck --continue` shows every error. The portal type-checks the web files it imports, so a web error shows up in both.
- `pnpm screenshot <path> [out.png] [width]`: screenshot a page (needs `npm start`). Use it instead of writing your own Playwright script; run it after every visual change. Flags (see the top of `scripts/screenshot.mjs`):
  - default: public page through the portal's `/preview` route with the **default** content from `copy.ts`/`content.ts`, not what's stored in Convex.
  - `--live`: the real site at :5173 with stored content.
  - `--portal`: a portal page, signed in as admin.
  - `--loading`: the loading skeleton.
  - `--widths=1440,390`: several widths in one run. It warns about horizontal overflow.
  - `--viewport` / `--selector=.css`: only the first screen, or only one element.
- **Other sessions often edit this repo at the same time** (the owner runs several in parallel). Run `git status` / `git diff <file>` before editing a file you read earlier, re-read it right before editing, and don't "fix" type errors in files you didn't touch; they're usually someone's edit in progress. Mention them instead.

## Where to change things

| To change | Edit |
| --- | --- |
| Any website text or image (defaults) | `apps/web/src/data/copy.ts`: one row per field `[page, section, label, key, default, kind]`. The portal editor is generated from these rows. |
| Loans, savings products (and their pages' text), FAQs, board, staff, partners, contact details, portal image picker | `apps/web/src/data/content.ts` (`servicePath`/`applyPath` give a product's page and Apply link) |
| Page layout | `apps/web/src/pages/*` (routes in `apps/web/src/App.tsx`) |
| Header, menu, footer | `apps/web/src/components/Layout.tsx` |
| Services hub and product pages | `apps/web/src/pages/Services.tsx` |
| Shared blocks (slider, page header, photo hero `HeroBanner`, closing `CtaBanner`, product cards, people grid, FAQ) | `apps/web/src/components/ui.tsx` |
| Colours, fonts, all public styling | `apps/web/src/styles.css` (tokens at the top) |
| Site search | `apps/web/src/data/search.ts` (client-side over live content; results at `/?s=`) |
| Editable page list in the portal, per-page validation | `apps/portal/src/data/content.ts` (`documents`, `applyDocument`, `contentError`) |
| Portal editor UI for lists and photos | `apps/portal/src/components/ContentFields.tsx` |
| Roles and permissions (shared by portal and backend) | `apps/portal/src/data/types.ts` (`can()`) |
| Content storage and server validation | `convex/content.ts` |
| Loading skeletons (shown while Convex data loads) | Website: `apps/web/src/components/Skeleton.tsx` (`SiteSkeleton`, used by `LiveWebsite` and the portal preview). Portal: `apps/portal/src/components/Skeleton.tsx` (`ShellSkeleton` for the session/workspace load, `PageSkeleton` picks one per route; add a case when you add a portal page). Styles are under "Loading skeleton" at the end of each app's `styles.css`. |
| Portal confirmations ("Saved.") and errors | `useFeedback()` in `apps/portal/src/components/ui.tsx`: `run(action, "Success message.")` shows the success as a toast (`components/Toast.tsx`, mounted in `main.tsx`) and errors inline where `{message}` is rendered. Use it for any new save/edit action. |
| Emails (confirmations, status updates, team alerts) and the portal Settings page | `convex/email.ts` (sending, templates, settings API), `apps/portal/src/data/email.ts` (template list, default wording), `apps/portal/src/pages/Settings.tsx`. Sending is skipped without `RESEND_API_KEY`; real recipients only when `EMAIL_LIVE=true` (see `convex/README.md`). |
| Error messages shown to people (both apps) | `apps/web/src/data/errors.ts` (`readableError`): shows our own `ConvexError("…")` text as is and maps sign-in codes, rate limits and network failures to plain sentences; never shows raw errors. Throw `ConvexError` with a readable sentence from server code; add a pattern there for any new library error. |
| Icons (both apps) | `apps/web/src/components/Icon.tsx`: `Icon` (names are the keys of `paths`), `ServiceIcon` (one per product), `SocialIcon`. The portal re-exports `Icon` from `components/ui.tsx`. |
| Images and fonts (both apps) | `apps/web/public/` (the portal's `publicDir` points there, so `/images/...` works in both). `public/logo.png` at the repo root is the owner's source logo, not served. Photo credits go in `docs/content-sources.md`. |
| Public application forms (incl. ID/photo uploads) | `apps/web/src/pages/Apply.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/ApplicationUpload.tsx` → `convex/applications.ts` (Convex file storage) |
| Form "sent" animation, form errors, bot timer (every public form) | `apps/web/src/components/SubmitSuccess.tsx` (`SubmitSuccess`, `FormError`, `useFormTimer`); spam/duplicate/rate-limit rules in `convex/lib/submissions.ts`. A new public form should use all three and call `guardSubmission`. |

## Public pages

Every inner page follows one pattern the owner asked for: photo `HeroBanner` at the top, content, then `CtaBanner` before the footer. New pages should do the same. The old grey `PageHeader` remains only on search results, blog posts and the 404 page.

| Route | Component | `copy.ts` page id |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` (`/?s=` = search) | `pages/Home.tsx` (`pages/Search.tsx`) | `home` |
| `/about-us/`, `/history/`, `/faq/` | `pages/About.tsx` | `about`, `history`, `faq` |
| `/board-of-directors/`, `/staff/`, `/loan-team/` | `pages/About.tsx` (`Board`, `Staff`) | `board`, `staff` |
| `/board-of-directors/<slug>/`, `/staff/<slug>/` (one per person) | `pages/Person.tsx` (`PersonProfile`) | `board`, `staff` ("Profile pages" rows; the people themselves are in `content.ts`) |
| `/services/`, `/services/<product>/` | `pages/Services.tsx` (`ServicesHub`, `ServiceDetail`) | `loans`, `saving` (product text is in `content.ts`) |
| `/downloads/` | `pages/Services.tsx` (`Downloads`) | `downloads` |
| `/registration-form/` and the other three forms | `pages/Apply.tsx` | `shared.forms-*`, plus a few `downloads.*` |
| `/photo-gallery/`, `/youtube-gallery/` (tabs of one Gallery page) | `pages/Gallery.tsx` | `photos`, `videos`, plus `shared.gallery-*` |
| `/contact-us/` | `pages/Contact.tsx` | `contact` |
| `/partners/` | `pages/Partners.tsx` | `partners` |
| `/blog/`, `/<post-slug>/` | `pages/Blog.tsx` | `blog` |
| header, menu, footer, help banner | `components/Layout.tsx`, `components/ui.tsx` | `shared` |

To find a page's fields: `grep -n '"<page id>\.' apps/web/src/data/copy.ts`.

## Finding things fast

- **CSS:** both `styles.css` files have a section comment per area. `grep -n "^/\* " apps/web/src/styles.css` gives a table of contents with line numbers. In the website CSS, most mobile rules are **not** next to the component: they're in the shared `/* Responsive */` media blocks at the end, so check both places. Tokens (colours, fonts) are at the top of each file.
- **Field kinds** (last column of a `copy.ts` row): `text` (default), `image` (`/images/<name>` or an uploaded `storage:` id), `url` (http/https). Empty URLs are allowed only for keys listed in `optionalUrl` in `copy.ts`. Validation is `contentError` in `apps/portal/src/data/content.ts`.
- **Forms in the preview:** the portal preview (and `pnpm screenshot` by default) renders public pages with `preview` set. Pages that submit to Convex (`Apply`, `Contact`) take a `preview` prop and refuse to submit with it. Do the same for any new form.

## Recipes

- **Add a text/image field:** add a row to `copy.ts`, use `c["page.key"]` in the page. Nothing else; stored pages fall back to defaults for new keys.
- **Add a website page:** add its id to `pageIds` in `copy.ts`, rows for its fields, a route in `App.tsx`, an entry in `documents` (portal `data/content.ts`), and a path in `search.ts`. Then run `pnpm exec convex run setup:addMissingPages`, because the database has no row for the new page (it leaves existing pages alone).
- **Add a field to every loan/savings product:** add it to `Product` and each product in `content.ts`, and to `productFields` (portal `data/content.ts`), which drives the editor and both validations. Stored products get the default for new fields (`withProductDefaults` in `convex/content.ts`), so no reset is needed.
- **Remove or rename a text/image field:** delete or edit its `copy.ts` row and its uses. Stored values for keys that no longer exist are ignored when the site loads and dropped on that page's next save, so no migration is needed. A renamed key starts from its new default. Moving a row to another page id also resets it to the default.
- **Change a default label that is already stored:** saved pages keep their old value. Give the row a new key so the new default shows (as done for `shared.nav-forms-downloads`).
- **Reset dev content to defaults** (wipes content edits): `pnpm exec convex run setup:resetPages`.
- **Change the Convex schema when data already exists:** a push fails if existing documents don't match. Loosen the field (optional / `v.string()`), push with `pnpm exec convex dev --once --typecheck disable` if types break, migrate the data with an internal mutation, then tighten and push again. Never use `--typecheck disable` for the final push. After adding application attachments, run `pnpm exec convex run setup:backfillApplicationAttachments` once on deployments that already had applications.
- **Board and staff people** (`Person` in `content.ts`: slug, name, role, photo, quote, bio, since, focus, email) are lists on the `board`/`staff` pages, edited in the portal like partners. New people get a slug from their name (`slugify`/`uniqueSlug`); people already on the live site keep theirs when renamed. Older saves stored `[name, role, photo]` rows; `toPeople` (used by `merge` in `convex/content.ts`) converts them on read, so no migration is needed. To add a field, add it to `Person`, `emptyPerson`, the defaults, `personLimits` in `convex/content.ts` and the editor in `ContentFields.tsx`.
- **Images:** put files in `apps/web/public/images/` with flat names (validation only accepts `/images/<name>`), compress large JPEGs, and add them to `imageLibrary` in `content.ts` so the portal offers them.

## Known pitfalls

- **Browsers launched by `pnpm screenshot` (local Chrome via playwright-core) reach Convex fine**, including `--live` and `--portal`. Some sandboxed browsers can't open the Convex websocket ("Connection closed before receiving a handshake response"); the page then stays on its loading skeleton. That's the environment, not a bug. Fall back to `ConvexHttpClient` from Node (sign in with the `auth:signIn` action using admin/admin).
- **Convex CLI network calls fail intermittently** (`fetch failed`). Retry before debugging. Don't pipe into `tail` when the exit code matters.
- **Query limits:** `.take(n)` silently truncates. Pages are read with `take(50)`; there are 16 page ids (`pageIds` in `copy.ts`). Raise limits if you add more.
- **Backend code is dense** (many one-line functions in `convex/`). Read whole functions before editing.
- **zsh:** never name a shell variable `path`; it overwrites `PATH`. Quote globs in flags: `grep -rn x apps --include='*.tsx'` (unquoted, zsh fails with "no matches found").

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
